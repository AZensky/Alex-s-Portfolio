# Portfolio

This portfolio was developed using React and Material UI. The portfolio utilizes Vite for fast development and its use of Hot Module Replacement (HMR). Using Vite over Create React App (CRA) allows for faster building and development, because Vite only rebundles files that are changed while CRA rebundles the whole app whenever there is a change in the code.
